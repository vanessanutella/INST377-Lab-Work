  ## JS and HTML Injection
    There are a bunch of methods to inject text or HTML into a document using JS
    Mainly, they're considered "unsafe" because they can spoof a page pretty easily
    But they're useful for starting to understand how websites work
    the usual ones are element.innerText and element.innerHTML
    Here's an article on the differences if you want to know more:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent#differences_from_innertext

  ## What to do in this function
    - Accept a list of restaurant objects
    - using a .forEach method, inject a list element into your index.html for every element in the list
    - Display the name of that restaurant and what category of food it is
*/
}

function processRestaurants(list) {
  console.log('fired restaurants list');

  /*
    ## Process Data Separately From Injecting It
      This function should accept your 1,000 records
      then select 15 random records
      and return an object containing only the restaurant's name, category, and geocoded location
      So we can inject them using the HTML injection function

      You can find the column names by carefully looking at your single returned record
      https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Health/Food-Inspection/umjn-t2iz

    ## What to do in this function:

    - Create an array of 15 empty elements (there are a lot of fun ways to do this, and also very basic ways)
    - using a .map function on that range,
    - Make a list of 15 random restaurants from your list of 100 from your data request
    - Return only their name, category, and location
    - Return the new list of 15 restaurants so we can work on it separately in the HTML injector

    ## Main Event
      Separating your main programming from your side functions will help you organize your thoughts
